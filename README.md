# Ring RTSP stream
A utility which allows you to get an RTSP stream from a ring camera (doorbell) device.

# My setup
I run [rtsp-simple-server](https://github.com/aler9/rtsp-simple-server) on the same machine as this node program, which allows me to view and record the RTSP stream inside ZoneMinder.
